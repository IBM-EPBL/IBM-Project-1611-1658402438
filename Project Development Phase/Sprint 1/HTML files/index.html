              Problem
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Now a day’s people are suffering from skin diseases, More than 125
              million people suffering from Psoriasis also skin cancer rate is
              rapidly increasing over the last few decades especially Melanoma
              is most diversifying skin cancer. If skin diseases are not treated
              at an earlier stage, then it may lead to complications in the body
              including spreading of the infection from one individual to the
              other. The skin diseases can be prevented by investigating the
              infected region at an early stage. The characteristic of the skin
              images is diversified so that it is a challenging job to devise an
              efficient and robust algorithm for automatic detection of skin
              disease and its severity. Skin tone and skin colour play an
              important role in skin disease detection. Colour and coarseness of
              skin are visually different. Automatic processing of such images
              for skin analysis requires quantitative discriminator to
              differentiate the diseases.

              Solution
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              To overcome the above problem we are building a model which is
              used for the prevention and early detection of skin cancer,
              psoriasis. Basically, skin disease diagnosis depends on the
              different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here
              the person can capture the images of skin and then the image will
              be sent the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect
              whether the person is having skin disease or not.
